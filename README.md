DriFiCrack is a **brute-force** tool to crack Wi-Fi passwords on WPA2/WPA3 
protected networks using brute force techniques. DriFiCrack is designed for educational purposes only, and should only be used on networks

DriFiCrack must be run as **root**. This is required by the suite 
of programs it uses.
